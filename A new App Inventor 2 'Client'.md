Hello!

I just got done building a new Windows app for App Inventor 2.
It's a 'Chromeless' client app for App Inventor 2 and it's got almost no gui or frame.
It uses a lot less RAM then Chrome and it keeps you more focused on app inventing!
Take a look for yourself!
It's a little slice of awesomeness!
I'm still making improvements but, the beta is out! Right here on GitHub!
Here's the link:

I hope you folks like it!
## Thank You for helping me become the man I am today!
